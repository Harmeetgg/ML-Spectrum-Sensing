FilterBankDesign.m is the function for designing filter banks. Type 'help FilterBankDesign' for details.

FilterBankStruct.m returns an empty filter bank structure. Type 'help FilterBankStruct' for details.  

A lot of designs examples for DFT, generalized DFT, and cosine modulated filter banks are given. For a customized different type of design, you need to feed the Gamma matrix and other design parameters correctly. 

Demos on how to use the designed filter banks are given too.
